# books
Join me on the journey to becoming a Backend Developer!

This is the first project in the series, titled Books. In this project, I explored using endpoints for the first time with the contextlib and FastAPI libraries, specifically utilizing nullcontext, Body, and FastAPI.

I created a list of dictionaries called books and implemented GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods, incorporating both path and query parameters.

Enjoy!
